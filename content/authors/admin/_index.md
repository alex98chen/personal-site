I am a Software Engineer by trade and a lifelong learner for fun! The goal for this site is to learn some basic web dev and also share my adventurers on a lower stakes platform than most social media. I assume my thoughts on many things will change so remember everything I say is just a reflection of my thoughts at the time :). Expect a lot of progress/reflection blog posts, hopefully with videos!
